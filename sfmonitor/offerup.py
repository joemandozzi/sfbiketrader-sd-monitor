"""OfferUp search scraper.

Unlike Craigslist, OfferUp's search requires a resolved geographic location
to return anything -- a plain HTTP request falls back to IP-based
geolocation (which, run from a random machine, can resolve to somewhere
hundreds of miles off). This module drives a real (headless) browser via
Playwright and emulates GPS coordinates for the configured zip code, which
OfferUp's location resolver accepts the same way it would from a phone.

Listings are read out of the page's server-rendered __NEXT_DATA__ blob (an
Apollo GraphQL cache Next.js embeds in the HTML) rather than scraped from
rendered markup -- that data contract is more stable than CSS selectors,
which change often as OfferUp's frontend evolves.

Ported from joemandozzi/bike-scraper's bikescraper/offerup.py.
