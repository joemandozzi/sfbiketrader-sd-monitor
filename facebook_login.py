"""One-time interactive Facebook login for accurate Marketplace location.

Facebook's logged-out Marketplace view resolves an IP-based default
location that can be wrong. Logging in lets you set an exact location via
Facebook's own "Change location" picker, which then gets respected on
subsequent searches.

This launches a REAL, VISIBLE browser window -- you log in yourself (and
handle any 2FA/checkpoint). It detects success automatically (Facebook
sets a "c_user" cookie once logged in) and saves the session to
data/fb_session.json so sfmonitor/facebook.py can reuse it headlessly.

That session file is effectively a login credential for your Facebook
account, stored in plaintext on this machine (data/ is gitignored, never
committed). Anyone with access to this machine's filesystem could use it
to access your Facebook account without your password or 2FA. Run this
again any time the session expires (Facebook logs you out).

Ported from joemandozzi/bike-scraper's facebook_login.py.
